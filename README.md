**Reach out to me:** wireless0@proton.me

I want to make things clear and transparent to everyone.

Anyone that claiming that I've used AI, yes I did, not for profit, not for any actual proper project. **keep reading.**

I will never or ever will touch AI again, i used it to speed one of projects that a friend (yutosh) started which was Fluxboard (I'm no longer friends with them) and they asked me to speed things up by using AI, but fuck.. never letting that happen again, basically any AI usage claims on me is right but I'm never touching AI ever again, it ruins reputation, it ruins my status, and it ruins the way I code and do stuff.

They used Antigravity with google one sub, and made me use Chatgpt and kiro IDE whatever the fuck it is..
Do not blame me on this & Do not ask about anything AI related to me, thank you everyone.

And about ApexSync or whatever it was, that was started up by (Caffeine) he put money on to it, and I was ready to help, but fuck me, I'm never helping anyone, now they're accusing me for using him, he never paid me, he never gave me money, nothing. he just paid for the host, vps, servers, domains. I didn't scam or did anything, please note that I'm no longer affiliated to them or anyone they are affiliated to, and do not ask or send more stuff about this. it ended.

And now, I'm clear off AI, removed any AI shit from my PC including KIRO IDE or whatever it is, and Chatgpt from my history, and never going back to anything AI related, I'm never touching or using it on my projects, or even asking it questions. I'm done with AI.

Thanks everyone.
