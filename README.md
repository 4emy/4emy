## About

I work at the intersection of kernel development and offensive security, with a focus on low-level exploitation and defense evasion. My research spans everything from Ring-0 internals to automotive protocol analysis.

**Ethics matter.** Everything I do is strictly white-hat—authorized research, red team engagements, and defensive work. No unauthorized access, no exceptions.

---

## What I Do

Most of my time is spent on:

- Kernel-mode exploit development (Windows/Linux)
- EDR and AV evasion research
- DMA attack vectors and physical memory manipulation
- Reverse engineering closed-source binaries and firmware
- CAN bus security and automotive protocol analysis
- Building tooling for red team operations
- Anti-cheat system analysis from a defensive perspective
- Database security analysis and authentication mechanism testing
- AI chatbot security and LLM prompt engineering research

I also dabble in symbolic reasoning systems and behavioral modeling, which has led to some interesting crossover work with large language models.

## Stack

**Low-level stuff:** Assembly (x86_64), C, C++23, Rust, Zig  
**Higher-level:** Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, C#, Lua, Nim  
**Tools:** IDA Pro, Ghidra, WinDbg, GDB, Frida, Binary Ninja

I spend most of my time in a debugger or staring at assembly. If it runs in kernel space or talks to hardware, I'm probably interested.

## Certifications

I've picked up a few certs over the years:

**Offensive Security**  
OSCP · OSWE · OSEP · OSCE³ · OSEE · GXPN

**Red Teaming**  
CRTOP (ZeroPoint Security) · MRT (MCSI)

**Other**  
PMP · BCBA-D

The hands-on experience matters more than the acronyms, but these help establish credibility.

## Background

I've founded and worked on several security-focused projects over the years:

**Security Infrastructure:** Spheer, Vik, Didatabase, FX, Rouwentery  
**Application Security Research:** EmpireClient, LipClient, Hox, RuneServerSide  
**AI Security Research:** Theroh, LipAI, Berry, ipav

Most of this work focuses on understanding vulnerabilities in systems and applications before they can be exploited maliciously—from game protection mechanisms to database authentication systems.

---

## Current Research

Most of my work is private due to sensitivity or NDA restrictions. A few things I can talk about:

**Tychon AI** — Custom 754B-parameter model focused on symbolic reasoning. Built some inference optimizations that made it actually usable.

**Kernel DMA research** — Tools for direct physical memory access from Ring-0. Useful for understanding modern memory protections and their limitations.

**Automotive security tooling** — CAN bus vulnerability scanner and exploitation framework. Turns out cars have terrible security models.

**Anti-cheat system analysis** — Research into game protection mechanisms from a defensive perspective. Understanding how they work helps build better defenses.

**Database security analysis** — Identifying vulnerabilities in database systems and authentication mechanisms through authorized penetration testing.

**EDR evasion research** — Ongoing work on understanding endpoint detection limitations. Published some findings, keeping others private for responsible disclosure.

If you're working on something interesting and want to collaborate, let's talk. Full portfolio available under NDA.

## Get in Touch - Be patient when reaching out—I actually go outside and I'm not active 24/7.

**Email:** wireless0@proton.me (use PGP for sensitive topics) (fastest response)
**Discord:** ciuqe (Not really using discord, but it is still a way to reach out to me)
**Discord Alt:** 0m2 (Not really using discord, but it is still a way to reach out to me)
**Telegram:** @kittywp  
**Threema:** 5AVDS52W
**Signal:** v44.04  
**Fluxer:** emy#0972
**Stoat:** 44#0089

**PGP Public Key:** https://privx.li/1syUJ6TjG

Use PGP if you're sharing anything sensitive. If you don't know what that means, Discord or email works fine.

I'm open to collaboration on security research, vulnerability disclosure, or just talking shop about low-level systems.
