I want to be 100% clear and transparent with everyone.

Yes, I used AI once or twice. Not for profit, not for any real long-term thing. Just one time to speed something up.
A friend (Yutosh) but note that we're no longer friends. Anways, they started Fluxboard and asked me to help push it faster. He straight up told me to use AI tools to get it done quicker. So I did. ChatGPT plus that Kiro IDE crap that they told me to use (they were running some Antigravity thing with a Google One sub also to code stuff they vibecoded). That was literally it. But fuck that. Never again.

I’m completely done with AI. I already deleted every trace from my PC: ChatGPT, Kiro IDE, everything. I’m not touching it for code, ideas, questions, nothing. It fucked my rep, messed with how I actually think and build, and I learned the hard way.

If someone wants to hit me with “you used AI” - yeah, that happened once, but that chapter is dead. Don’t ask me anything AI-related. Don’t bring it up. We’re good.

Separately, ApexSync (or whatever it ended up being called): that was Caffeine’s project. He paid for hosting, VPS, servers, domains, all that. I said I’d help because we were on good terms. He never paid me a single cent. I never asked for money, never took any. Now people are saying I scammed or used him. That’s straight bullshit. I didn’t take a thing from him.

I’m not involved with ApexSync, Caffeine, or anyone connected to that mess anymore. It’s over. Done. Don’t @ me, don’t send drama, I’m out. That’s the whole story.

Back to writing code the normal way. No shortcuts, no AI crutches.

Thanks to anyone who actually read this.
