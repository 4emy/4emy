About usage of AI, I will never or ever will touch AI again, i used it to speed one of projects that a friend (yutosh) started which was Fluxboard (I'm no longer friends with them) and they asked me to speed things up by using AI, but fuck.. never letting that happen again, basically any AI usage claims on me is right but I'm never touching AI ever again, it ruins reputation, it ruins my status, and it ruins the way I code and do stuff.

They used Antigravity with google one sub, and made me use chatgpt and kiro IDE whatever the fuck it is..

Do not blame me on this.

Do not ask about anything AI related to me, thank you everyone.
